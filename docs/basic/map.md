# House and Electrical Map


The house has around seventy different hot wires. One hot wire can power one light or a mixture of lights. In addition the house has many rooms. I had to number all the hot cables as well as name all the rooms in the house to make senses of the electrical system.

It was quite a laborious job, thankfully all is done, moving forward you can just reference the folloing diagrams and pictures to know which wire controls what.

## The House Map

To make sense of the system, I first divided the physical space into logical zones. Then I named them, based on what made sense to me. To avoid confusion, I am adding what I named each room in the map below. 

You can call the rooms whatever you want in the future, however these are the names that are used to link the wires to a specific room.

## The Master Wire List

Each cable listed below is physically tagged with a numbered sticker corresponding to the **Cable #** column. These numbers represent the "Hot" AC wires that are now connected to the smart relays.

You can also access the list below in [Spreadsheet format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n_0zUwem4akHZQGzYcW9seihyMPRHdoofeY7YOCWh88/edit?usp=sharing).

### Bundled Cables

It is important to note that while there are 70 individual wires, some have been **bundled together** to work as a single unit. For example, **Cable 4** (Staircase Garage to 1st Floor) and **Cable 5** (Staircase 1st to 2nd Floor) are joined at the relay. This means instead of having two separate switches for the stairs, they both turn on at once for convenience. 

You can find more details about which cables are grouped together in the section *How the house works now*.


:::caution A Note on the "Unknown"
**Wire #68** is currently labeled as Unknown. During testing, this wire did not appear to activate any visible fixtures. My suspecious is that it used to be connected to a disconnected feature in the Master room.
