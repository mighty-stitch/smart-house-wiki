# Electrical Overview

Before understanding how this house works, it helps to understand how electricity normally works in a typical home.

We’ll start simple.

## How Electricity Works in a Normal House

Electricity comes from the utility company into your **main electrical panel**. From there, it travels through wires to outlets, switches, and lights.

For a basic light circuit, there are three important parts:

- **Hot wire** – brings electricity from the panel to the device.
- **Neutral wire** – carries electricity back to the panel.
- **Ground wire** – safety path (we won’t focus on it for now).

### The Basic Idea

Electricity needs a complete loop to work.

If the loop is complete → the light turns on.  
If the loop is broken → the light turns off.

In a traditional house, the **wall switch physically breaks the hot wire**.

When you flip the switch:
- ON → it connects the hot wire → electricity flows → light turns on.
- OFF → it disconnects the hot wire → electricity stops → light turns off.

The important thing to understand:

> The wall switch directly controls the power going to the light.

There is no computer. No brain. No network.  
Just a mechanical break in the hot wire.

Simple. Reliable. Very old-school.

## How Electricity Worked in a LiteTouch House

Now things get interesting.

In a LiteTouch system, the wall switches did **not** directly control the electricity going to the light.

Instead of each switch breaking the hot wire, the house was wired differently.

All the light circuits were routed back to a central relay panel.  
The wall switches were just low-voltage control buttons.

Think of it like this:

- The switches did not carry the main power for the lights.
- They sent signals to a central control panel.
- The panel contained relays.
- The relays turned the lights on or off.

So instead of:

Switch → Light

It was:

Button → Control Panel → Relay → Light
