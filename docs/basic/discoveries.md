# Infrastructure Discoveries

During the process of auditing the 70 circuits and migrating the system, several electrical anomalies were discovered. While these findings fall outside the immediate scope of the LiteTouch modernization project, they are documented here for future reference.

## Bathroom Outlets

A significant discovery was made regarding the bathroom outlets. Unlike modern electrical standards—where bathrooms are typically isolated (one breaker per bathroom), **every bathroom outlet in this house is tied to a single circuit breaker.**

:::note Technical Implications
A high-amp load (such as a hair dryer or space heater) used in one bathroom has the potential to trip the breaker for every bathroom in the entire house. 
:::

**Also to be noted is that none of the bathrooms outlets are GFCI outlets**.

## Unidentified & Abandoned Cables

While 70 cables were successfully mapped, there are two specific outliers that remain "dark":

### Cable 68
Cable 68 is officially documented as **Unknown**. During testing, this cable showed no continuity to any visible light fixtures or outlets. 

### The "Cardboard" Cable
In the lower right box, there is an additional unnumbered cable marked with a piece of cardboard. Unlike the other 70 cables, this one was never labeled with a sticker and has not been assigned a number.

## Master Bedroom Modifications

At some point in the home's history, the Master Bedroom underwent a partial "de-coupling" from the LiteTouch system. It appears that a previous renovation bypassed the centralized control logic for certain fixtures in favor of traditional, direct-wired switches.

It is highly probable that **Cable 68** originally belonged to one of these Master Room fixtures before the wiring was redirected.
